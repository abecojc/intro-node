# intro-node-me
This repo is my brief resume where there are details about my experience, training and skills that I have acquired as a full stack web developer. I am eager to bring value to your organization and projects utilizing the tools I have become familiar with. You will find my contact information in the resume. The latest version 1.2.1 contains formatted package.json and a postman collection. It was deployed to heroku under the same package name. Thank you.
